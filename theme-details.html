					<h2><strong>Confession for 2025</strong></h2>
					<p><strong>In 2025, I boldly affirm that I am a child of God, guided by the Holy Spirit. I have been freed from the kingdom of darkness and now belong to God. I walk in the light because Jesus is the light. I am anointed and a joint heir with Jesus, which makes me more than a conqueror. As a doer of His word, I am a channel of blessings to others, destined to lend and not borrow. No one can stand against me because God is with me and for me; I am blessed in my comings and goings. He has empowered me to create wealth and prosper. I thank You, Lord, for commanding blessings on my storehouse and for opening Your good treasures to me. I will not encounter defeat in 2025 because I am under opened heavens. I am the head and not the tail and dwell in the secret place of the Most High, where no weapon formed against me or my family shall prosper in the name of Jesus.
					Any curses or negative utterances directed at me and my family are reversed in the name of Jesus and cannot take root in us. God is my refuge and fortress, so I fear not the schemes of the enemy; no evil or plague shall come near my dwelling this year because His angels are in charge over my life. According to 1 Peter 2:24, by the stripes of Jesus, I am healed, and therefore sickness, disease, afflictions, and infections cannot enter my body in Jesus' name. I stand without spot or blemish, cleansed by the blood of Jesus.
					Welcome, 2025; I anticipate fulfillment, fruitfulness, and breakthroughs throughout the year. As divine blessings and favour chase and overtake me, I embrace 2025 as my year of divine opportunities. Thank you, Jesus, for allowing me to experience everything I have confessed today, in your Name, Amen.</strong></p>
